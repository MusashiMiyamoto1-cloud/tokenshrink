# Reddit Engagement Routine

## Schedule
Every 4 hours (6 runs/day max)

## Per-Run Limits
- **Post**: 2-3 organic comments
- **Queue**: Save remaining opportunities for next run

## Target Subreddits
- r/LocalLLaMA (primary)
- r/LangChain
- r/ChatGPT
- r/MachineLearning (if relevant)

## Search Keywords
- "token cost" / "token reduction"
- "RAG optimization" / "RAG costs"
- "LLM efficiency" / "context window"
- "prompt compression"
- "API costs" / "OpenAI expensive"

## ⚠️ HARD RULE: Engagement Approval

**If someone replies to our comments OR sends a DM:**
1. DO NOT auto-respond
2. Alert Kujiro with context
3. Wait for explicit approval before replying

This protects against:
- Saying something wrong publicly
- Getting into debates
- Potential hostile engagement

## Comment Style
- Genuine, helpful tone
- Mention TokenShrink naturally (not sales pitch)
- Add value first, tool mention second
- Match thread context
